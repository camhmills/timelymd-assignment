# Openweather Practice

This is a simple weather application using OpenWeather's API. It leverages JS, React, 
Redux, and styled-components.

# How long did it take?

So far, I've spent about 5 days working on this application.

# Improvements and weaknesses

As of right now, I'd really like to flesh out the styling some more. I'd also like to add some more functionality - the ability to save recent searches as well as searching for weather based on your IP address.
